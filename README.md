# Space Tonbow

Soar through outerspace as the giant mechanical dragonfly, Tonbow, taking out enemy orbs swarming the stars
in this arcade-style Sega Master System game!

For me this feels like a big step up over Triangle Puzzle. I spent a lot of time working on this one,
and yet at the same time, things came together rather quickly when I focused on the project. So what
do we have to show off this time?

Well as always, it of course works on real Sega Master System (or in this case Sega Mark III) hardware!

I've also added Mega Drive/Genesis START button support!

But the coolest feature is that this is (to my knowledge) the first Sega Master System game to support TATE mode!

Controls are quite simple, the d-pad moves Tonbow around screen and the 1-button causes him to dash forward
in an attack that can take out the enemy orbs.

You can also hold down the 2-button for easy strafing!

But watch out! Not only will the orbs kill you, but when they reach the end of the screen, they'll fire off 
a projetile that can't be dashed into!

This game will require either a flash cartridge to play on real Sega hardware, or an emulator to play on any other device. 

So, what kind of high score can you get?
